# Arcade Game Project: Frogger Clone
This game is part of Udacity's  Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. The Arcade Game clone is inspired by the game _Frogger_. The mission is to lead the player to the water using the arrow keys. _Easy peasy_, right? But you must watch out for the ladybugs: if the hero and the enemies collide, you must start again.

## How to play the game

In this game you have a player and enemies (ladybugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move **left**, **right**, **up** and **down** using the **keyboard**. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
